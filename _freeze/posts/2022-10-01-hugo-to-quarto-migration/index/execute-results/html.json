This contains a few thoughts and tips.\nauthor: Andreas Handel\ndate: '2022-10-01'\ndate-modified: \"2023-07-06\"\naliases: \n  - ../quarto-website-migration/\ncategories: \n- Quarto\n- Hugo\n- Website\nimage: \"featured.png\"\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nLike many folks who use `R`, `RMarkdown` and related products a lot, I was excited about the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package and used it to build my website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Also as many did, I used the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) (back then called Academic) theme. I [wrote about that setup here](/posts/blogdown-website-1/).\n\nThe results were nice, but both Hugo and Wowchemy kept changing all the time and stuff kept breaking. It wasn't robust, it got rather complex and fiddly, etc. I started dreading making changes to the website. Enter [Quarto](https://quarto.org). I first watched from the sidelines thinking that my current setup was ok and I didn't need to change (yet). But after a few online presentations, I was convinced that Quarto was the new way forward and would in the long run provide a much better experience.\n\nI therefore decided to tackle the website conversion project. I had a lot of help from others who already did this (I'll provide links below).\n\nI wanted the new website to be as close in content/functionality as the old website. Since I didn't have 100s of pages to convert, I was ok doing some manual adjustments. \nHere is a brief summary of what I did and some pointers to a few things I learned that might help others.\n\n\n# Who this is (not) for\n\nThis most directly targets folks who want to switch from blogdown/Hugo to Quarto. I'm hosting things on Netlify, but it should work for other hosting platforms too. Some of the tips might also be useful for folks who plan to build a Quarto website from scratch.\n\nThis is not a detailed walk-through. For that, see the Quarto documentation or for instance [this blog post](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/). I'll describe a lot of steps only briefly, and make comments on some topics that might be not yet commonly known. \n\n\n\n# Setting up the website\n\nI started by creating a new Quarto website. Either [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) or these blog posts [by Danielle Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) and [Albert Rapp](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) worked well. \n\nFor the main page, I simply used the [about page template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) that is built into Quarto. (While my `about.qmd` page is just a regular page.)\n\nI structured the new website to be as similar to my old as possible. For me, that meant folders and subfolders for `posts`, `presentations` and `projects`, and all other files (e.g. `about.qmd`) in the top level.\n\nNote that while I have `posts` and `presentations` separately, and under the old setup those pages were somewhat different, with Quarto there is (currently) no separate styling for presentations, thus it is basically another collection of posts. Only in this case, each post just contains the basic information of the presentation and a link to the slides and other relevant material. The same is true for the `projects`, they follow again the same structure as the `posts`, just somewhat differently formatted. \n\nIt would be possible to tune more, and make the `presentations` entries display differently. But I wanted to keep it simple, I learned that too much customization is just a time suck for me 😁.\n\nFor the projects, I made a change. They are also set up like `posts`, but I wanted the image that's shown as thumbnail to also show on each page explaining a project. That was the way it was on my old site. I was thinking of messing with the project pages, but realized I could just use one of the ['about' page layout templates](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html) and that would do the trick. So I just added the `solona` template into the YAML of each file and got a layout that looked good enough for what I wanted.\n\n\n# Configuring the site\n\nThe main file for setting configurations is the `_quarto.yml` file. Additional configurations can be done in `_metadata.yml` inside the `posts` and `presentations` folders. I followed a mix of the Quarto documentation and the blog posts mentioned above and below to configure those files. You can check out my setup [on the GitHub repo of this page](https://github.com/andreashandel/andreashandelwebsite).\n\n\n# Converting YAML sections\n\nI had to do a bunch of manual conversions of all the `index.qmd` files that go with each post and presentation. It was a bit tedious but not too bad. Basically, I had to remove anything from the YAML that was specific for Hugo/Wowchemy and format it to have the fields [supported by Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html). I found [Danielle's post](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/) to be helpful for a quick orientation. (Note that she converts from Distill, so her starting point is slightly different, but the new Quarto entries are the same.)\n\n\n\n# Setting up a 404/not found page\n\nThis is not really required, but I liked [this approach from Lucy D’Agostino McGowan](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/posts/2022-09-19-migrating-from-hugo-to-quarto/) and decided to mostly copy it and adjust a bit for my purposes.\n\n\n# Turning on comments\n\nI used `utterances` before to allow folks to comment on certain sites. This can be done easily as explained in [this Quarto documentation section](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting). \nTo prevent comments on certain pages, one can turn those off in the YAML, also also described on the Quarto documentation page. An alternative is to place the `utterances` information into the `_metadata.yml` files, which then means comments are only on for those specific files/folders, in my case the blog posts and the presentations.\n\n\n\n# HTML form embedding\n\n**Update 2023-01-09:** At the end of 2022, I decided to stop doing my newsletter for the time being and turned off the newsletter subscription section.\nLeaving this here since it might still be of general interest to figure out how to embed HTML.\n\nFor my newsletter subscription page, I embed HTML code produced by Mailchimp. It took me a little bit to figure out how to do it.\n[This tip](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/12-html-block/) explained it, basically the setup looks like this:\n\n\n````markdown\n```{=html}\nALL THE HTML STUFF FROM MAILCHIMP GOES HERE\n```\n````\n\n\n\n\n# Redirects 1\n\nMy previous website used `slug:` labels in the YAML to provide shortened URLs. I wanted to keep those old URLs so breaking links are minimized. First I was thinking of following [this example by Danielle Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/#netlify-redirects) and adjusting the code such that it parses the YAML of all my `index.qmd` files, pulls out the slug part and builds the paths and redirect table. It should have worked for me since I'm also hosting this website on Netlify, like Danielle.\n\nBut then I found a simpler option, using the [`aliases:` setting](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html), [here is a an explanation/example](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html#cookies-analytics-extensions-and-more-miscellaneous-stuff). I tried to do an automated search and replace, but it didn't quite work, so I ended up doing it manually. I basically replaced this:\n\n````markdown\nslug: publications-analysis-1\n````\n\nwith this:\n\n````markdown\naliases: \n  - ../publications-analysis-1/\n````\n\nin the YAML of all my posts (my presentations didn't use slugs).\n\n\n**Note on this:** I ran into some problems initially. Since I was mapping into the same file structure, just a different file name, I wrote this:\n\n````markdown\naliases: \n  - publications-analysis-1\n````\n\nThat didn't work. On contemplation, the alias is referenced to the current document. So if my file is `https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2020-02-01-publications-analysis-1/` I need to move up a folder and place the alias folder/file `publications-analysis-1` there. That was confusing on first try. I only figured it out once I looked into the `_site` folder to see what Quarto was producing, and from that deduced the right setup.\n\n\n# Redirects 2\n\nAfter I got the `aliases` bit to work, I realized that I needd further redirects. On my old blog, I had `andreashandel.com/talk` redirect to `andreashandel.com/presentations`. The first URL is on many of my presentation slides and I didn't want to change them all. So I figured I should use [Danielle's approach](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/#netlify-redirects) after all, and make a small `_redirects` file that contained these. Basically it looks like this:\n\n\n````markdown\n/talk /presentations\n/talks /presentations\n/post /posts\n````\n\nI followed her instructions of placing this bit of code into the main `index.qmd` file.\n\n**Update 2023-07-06:** \nI noticed that sometimes when I build the website, the whole `_site` folder gets erased and rebuilt (which also deletes the `_redirects` file). But the `index.qmd` file might not get re-executed since I'm using the `execute: freeze` option in my `_quarto.yml` file to prevent running everything each time. This means the code snippet inside `index.qmd` which makes the `_redirects` file isn't run. The solution I found was to use Quarto's [Post-render functionality](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html). Basically I placed the few lines of code that I got from Danielle's example into a separate `makeredirects.R` script and added that to the main `_quarto.yml` file as\n\n```markdown\nproject:\n  post-render:\n    - makeredirects.R\n```\nIt now runs each time after the rendering and produces the needed redirect file.\n\n\n\n# Widgets\n\nOn my previous website, I had several sections (widgets) on the main page under the static welcome text. Those showed my Twitter feed and most recent posts and presentations. I was trying to see if I can reproduce that with Quarto. Based on [this example](https://robertmitchellv.com/blog/2022-08-building-with-quarto/building-with-quarto.html#building-blocks) it seems one could do something like that. I contemplated giving it a try. But then I decided to keep it simple, and let interested readers klick on my Twitter/Posts/Presentations sections if they want. No need to complicate things 😁. \n\n\n\n# Custom footer\n\nI had a footer with copyright text that I wanted to keep. [Albert Rapp's post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html#add-a-footer-below-blog-posts) has an example of using an html file. I had that setup on my previous site, but I didn't quite like the inclusion of html. I instead added the footer using the `page-footer` section in `_quarto.yml` as [described here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#footer). I basically copied [this statement from one of Andrew Heiss' courses](https://bayesf22.classes.andrewheiss.com/). To get the alignment right, I also had to grab a bit of code out of his `custom.scss` file and stick it int my `custom.css` file (I don't really know the difference between `scss` and `css`, seemed easier to place it into the `css` file.)\n\n\n# Extensions\n\nTo get the nice icons in the footer that Andrew has, one needs to install an extension. In this case, it's the `fontawsome` extension. This is easily done, [as described here.](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) or [here](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/posts/18-font-awesome/). I expect many more cool extensions to show up soon.\n\n\n\n# Other settings\n\nI'm using Google Analytics, it is easy [to include that in a Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#google-analytics). I also turned on the [Cookies setting notification](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-tools.html#cookie-consent) (I don't use any cookies directly, but Google Analytics likely does, and probably Mailchimp that I use for my newsletter too?).\n\n\n# Publishing\n\nI host my website on Netlify. I followed the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html). First I did a `quarto publish netlify`. That placed my website onto Netlify and gave it a temporary URL. That was great for testing it online (as opposed to testing locally with Quarto's preview option, which of course I used a lot as well). Once online, I ran a link checker (I like using [Dr Link Check](https://www.drlinkcheck.com) but there are many others.) Of course there were broken internal links, so I went ahead and fixed them. I decided that I like the somewhat manual publishing of the site instead of doing it automatically with GitHub integration (also an option described in the Quarto documentation, and what I was using). The manual approach means I can mess around with new blog posts and sync with GitHub and don't have to worry about using the main branch or not and then only once things look good do I publish with Quarto. So I changed my setup to that. That was done easily by setting the information in the `_publish.yml` file to point to my actual website URL, and changing the settings on the Netlify side as described in the Quarto documentation.\n\n\n# Summary\n\nOverall, it wasn't too hard. The one item that got me stuck for a bit was the `aliases` issue as described above. The conversion did require some manual changing, which I'm sure I could have written R scripts for it, but since my webpage isn't that large, it seemed easier to just do things by hand. The new site is slightly different, some parts are simplified, but I got pretty much the same functionality and content back. And it is a **much simpler** setup compared to the - in my opinion - fairly convoluted setup of Hugo/blogdown/Wowchemy. Overall I'm happy with the results. [My research group website](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/) is still using blogdown/Hugo/Wowchemy. That one has a few more custom layout features, which would likely require some fiddling before they work in Quarto. However, I have high hopes for those extensions and I'm pretty sure soon someone will have made new layouts, and then I might just be able to use some of them. So research group website conversion will happen, though probably not this year 😄.\n\n\n\n# Further resources\n\nIn addition to the [main Quarto website](https://quarto.org) and the blogs mentioned above, the [a Quarto tip a day](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and [Thomas Mock's materials](https://github.com/jthomasmock) (look for his Quarto training repositories) are great resources. [This repo](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2022/get-started-quarto) has materials for one of his workshops, [here](https://jthomasmock.github.io/quarto-2hr-webinar/) is another one. [This tutorial](https://ivelasq.quarto.pub/building-a-blog-with-quarto/) by Isabella Velásquez is another nice resource describing specifically Quarto blogs. \n\n\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nIt should be obvious that I owe a lot of these ideas to the blog posts and other resources I cite above. So thanks to those who tried it before me and wrote about it!\n\n",
