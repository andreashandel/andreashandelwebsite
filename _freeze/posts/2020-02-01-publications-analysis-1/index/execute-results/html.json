In the past, I also needed similar information for NSF grant applications. \n\nInstead of doing things by hand, there are nicer/faster ways using R. The following shows a few things one can do with the [`scholar` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=scholar). I describe an alternative approach using the [`bibliometrix` package](https://www.bibliometrix.org/) in [part 2](/posts/publications-analysis-2/) of this post.\n\n\n# Notes\n\n* As of this writing, the `scholar` R package seems semi-dormant and not under active development. If Google changes their API for Scholar and the package isn't updated, the below code might stop working. \n\n* A problem I keep encountering with Google Scholar is that it starts blocking requests, even after what I consider are not that many attempts to retrieve data. I notice that when I try to pull references from Google Scholar using `JabRef` and also with the code below. If that happens to you, try a different computer, or clear cookies. This is a well known problem and if you search online, you find others complaining about it. I haven't found a great solution yet, other than not using the Google Scholar data. I describe such an approach in [part 2](/posts/publications-analysis-2/) of this post. However, some analyses are only able with Google Scholar information.\n\n* To minimize chances of getting locked out by Google, I wrote the code below such that it only sends a request if there isn't a local file already containing that data. To refresh data, delete the local files.\n\n# Required packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scholar)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Get all citations for an individual\n\nFirst, I'm using Google Scholar to get all citations for a specific author (in this case, myself).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Define the person to analyze\nscholar_id=\"bruHK0YAAAAJ\" \n#either load existing file of publications\n#or get a new one from Google Scholar\n#delete the file to force an update\nif (file.exists('citations.Rds'))\n{\n  cites <- readRDS('citations.Rds')\n} else {\n  #get citations\n  cites <- scholar::get_citation_history(scholar_id) \n  saveRDS(cites,'citations.Rds')\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Compare citations for different time periods\n\nFor my purpose, I want to compare citations between 2 time periods (my Assistant Professor time and my Associate Professor time).

One thing I notice is that this contains more entries than I have peer-reviewed publications. Since most people's Google Scholar profile (including my own) list items beyond peer-reviewed journal articles, one likely needs to do some manual cleaning before analysis. That is not ideal. I'll do/show a few more possible analyses, but decided to do the analyses below using the approach [in part 2](/posts/publications-analysis-2/).\n\n\n# Making a table of journals and impact factors\n\n_This used to work, but as of 2022-09-10 when I tried to re-run, it failed. Seems like `get_impactfactor()` doesn't exist anymore. Maybe they got in trouble with the owners of ImpactFactor? Leaving it here, but code chunk below doesn't run._\n\nThe `scholar` package has a function that allows one to get impact factors for journals. This data doesn't actually come from Google Scholar, instead the package comes with an internal spreadsheet/table with impact factors. Looking a bit into the `scholar` package indicates that the data was taken from some spreadsheet posted on ResearchGate (probably not fully legal). Either way, let's give it a try.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#here I only want publications since 2015\npub_reduced <- publications %>% dplyr::filter(year>2014)\n# my guess is they got in trouble with the owners of ImpactFactor?\nifdata <- scholar::get_impactfactor(pub_reduced$journal) \n#Google SCholar collects all kinds of 'publications'\n#including items other than standard peer-reviewed papers\n#this sorts and removes some non-journal entries  \niftable <- ifdata %>% dplyr::arrange(desc(ImpactFactor) ) %>% tidyr::drop_na()\nknitr::kable(iftable)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOK so this doesn't quite work. I know for instance that I didn't publish anything in _Cancer Journal for Clinicians_ and the 2 _Rheumatology_ entries are workshop presentations. Oddly, when I look at `publications$journal` there is no Cancer Journal listed. Somehow this is a bug created by the `get_impactfactor()` function. I could fix that by hand. The bigger problem is what to do with all those publications that are not peer-reviewed papers. I could remove them from my Google scholar profile. But I kind of want to keep them there since some of them link to useful stuff. I could alternatively manually clean things at this step. This somewhat defeats the purpose of automation. \n\n# Getting list of co-authors\n\nAnother useful piece of information to have, e.g. for NSF grants, is a table with all co-authors.\nUnfortunately, `get_publications()` only pulls from the main Google Scholar page, which cuts off the author list. To get all authors, one needs to run through each paper using `get_complete_authors()`. \nThe problem is that Google cuts off access if one sends too many queries. If you get error messages, it might be that Google blocked you. See the _Notes_ section. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nallauthors = list()\nif (file.exists('allauthors.Rds'))\n{\n  allauthors <- readRDS('allauthors.Rds')\n} else {\n  for (n in 1:nrow(publications)) \n  {\n    allauthors[[n]] = get_complete_authors(id = scholar_id, pubid = publications[n,]$pubid)\n  }\n  saveRDS(allauthors,'allauthors.Rds')\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nTheoretically, if the above code runs without Google blocking things, I should end up with a list of all co-authors which I could then turn into a table. The problem is still that it pulls all entries on my Google Scholar profile, and not just peer-reviewed papers. With a bit of cleaning I could get what I need. But overall I don't like this approach too much. \n\n# Discussion\n\nWhile the `scholar` package has some nice features, it has 2 major problems: \n\n* Google blocking the script if it decides too many requests are made (that can happen quickly). \n* Since most people's Google Scholar profile (including my own) list items beyond peer-reviewed journal articles, one likely needs to do some manual cleaning before analysis.\n\nI do keep all my published, peer-reviewed papers in a BibTeX bibliography file in my reference manager (I'm using Zotero and/or Jabref). I know that file is clean and only contains peer-reviewed papers. Unfortunately, the `scholar` package can't read in such data. In [part 2](/posts/publications-analysis-2/) of this post series, I'll use a different R package to produce the journal and author tables I tried making above.\n\nThe one feature only available through Google Scholar is the citation record and the analysis I did at the beginning if this post. \n\n\n\n",
