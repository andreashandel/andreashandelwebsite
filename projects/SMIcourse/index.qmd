Simulation Modeling in Immunology (SMI) is an annual workshop that I co-teach with my colleague Paul Thomas. It usually occurs each year in July in Seattle. In 2020 we taught it online. All course materials are available in the form of a simple GitHub website and can be used by anyone for self-learning. You can find the course [on this site](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/).

The course makes heavy use of my [DSAIRM R package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/).
