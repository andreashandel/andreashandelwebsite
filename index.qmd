I am currently the UGA Foundation Professor in Public Health and Associate Department Head in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://publichealth.uga.edu/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/), [College of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.uga.edu/), at the [University of Georgia (UGA)](https://www.uga.edu/).

My research and teaching is in the area of data analytics, statistical inference, and computational modeling, with a focus on infectious diseases.

This website contains [a short bio](about.qmd) and products such as [blog posts](posts.qmd), [presentations](presentations.qmd), and [various tools and resources related to teaching and research](projects.qmd).

More research related details can be found [on my research group site](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/). Some overlap between the two sites might occur.
